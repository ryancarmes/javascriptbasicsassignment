    <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3> <!-- main content heading -->
    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScripit is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operatiors assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <u> var x = 10;</u></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <u>true</u> or <u>false;</u>null - <u>null</u> aka nothing; Number - <u>42</u> or <u>3.14159;</u> String - <u>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</u> Array - <purple>[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</u> and Object -<u>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</u></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <u>if</u> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <u>else if</u> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <purple>else</purple> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">Function</a> Functions are an encapspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
